# README -- ce-store/CeStore

This CeStore project implements a basic HTTP REST wrapper for the core CeStore project, exposing all core functionality as a rich and consistent set of HTTP REST APIs.  These are documented (see "docs" folder and "help" link at the top of the CeEngineeringPanel) and are used extensively by the CeEngineeringPanel project which builds a sample user interface on top of these HTTP REST APIs.

Refer to the CONTRIBUTE.md file for details on how to get involved with this project.
