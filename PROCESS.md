# CE Store Process

The CE Store (ce-store) organisation within www.github.org is an IBM initiated open source organisation focused on providing an experimental research environment for the ITA Controlled English language. We actively encourage anyone interested in ITA Controlled English and the CE store to participate and contribute to the projects within this organization.

# Proposals

We welcome proposals for new projects to join the CE Store organisation. The process for a new proposal is:

1. Open a new Issue in the ce-store/administration repository. Give it a meaningful title and describe the proposal in the issue. The proposal will be discussed by commenting on the issue.
2. Once the proposal has been discussed, there will be a vote by CE Store team recorded in the proposal Issue.  Outcomes are:
   * proposal accepted, new repository created and project started;
   * proposal accepted, work assigned to an existing project;
   * proposal rejected.
   Proposals will be accepted for CE Store if they demonstrate value to a broad audience in the CE and CE Store community. Some projects may be recommended for incubation outside the CE Store community.

# Committers

The CE Store organisation will create an initial set of committers when a repository/project is created. Each repository will have a team created called reponameCommitters and these people will have write access to the repository. To become a committer the process is:
* Establish a good track record of contributions and have a signed individual contributor agreement in place;
* Be nominated by an existing committer via an Issue titled *Committer Nomination: persons name @githubid*;
* Existing committers will then vote in the Issue and 2/3 positive votes are required to be a committer.
The CE Store team reserves the right to revoke committer status for individuals that are deemed to not be acting in the best interests of the project.

# Process

* Issues will be tracked using github issues.
* The project github wiki will be used for communication of ideas, designs, news, etc...

# Branches

Main branch will be called master and is considered to be buildable. This branch is expected to work and anything pushed to that branch is considered to work. Care will be taken to ensure that this branch is always stable, works and new work can be branched from it.

Feature or work branches should be created from the main branch and given a meaningful title. As work proceeds in these branches changes should be regularly pushed to the server in order for people to see the progress as it is being made. Once a feature/work branch is ready to merge with the master branch a pull request should be created and the project committer(s) will review the changes and update the main branch.
